# MY472 - Data for Data Scientists

## Final assignment, MT 2022

---

The goal of this final assignment is to demonstrate your proficiency using the techniques taught throughout the course. **It is an individual assignment. No discussion of the assignment with others or any other collaboration is allowed.**

Feel free to use code snippets from the course materials and other sources to guide your work. Remember, however, that you **always have to cite**  when using code from any source such as e.g. Stack Overflow, GitHub repos, previous assignments, and others.

## Submission guidelines

You will have to submit the assignment using GitHub classroom. It will be graded based on the compiled/knitted RMarkdown file in `.html` format. **Submissions without an `.html` file will receive 20 points penalty.**

## Deadline

The **deadline** to submit the assignment is Tuesday, 17 January, 2pm (London time).

Late submission will receive a penalty of 5 marks for every 24 hours after the deadline.

## Formatting

Up to 5/100 marks of this final assignment will be given to reward students with particularly well formatted and readable documents. Consider your final HTML document like a polished report or term paper that you submit.

  - __Do not__ print out the whole dataset in your knitted document (it is fine to show how the data look like with `head()`)
  - __Readability__ not just of the markdown texts but also of your code is helpful for grading and more generally also for yourself to avoid bugs or when revisiting it in the future. You can e.g. have a look at this Style guide https://style.tidyverse.org/
  - Present only what is __necessary__, but make sure that it __answers the question__


Good luck with the final assignment of the course!
