#### Rmarkdown guide:

  - Try to build your knitted assignment like a __polished report__
  - __Do not__ print out whole datasets in your knitted document (it is fine to show how the data look like with `head()`)
  - __Readability__ of your code is helpful for grading and more generally also for yourself to avoid bugs or when revisiting it in the future. You can e.g. have a look at this Style guide https://style.tidyverse.org/
